# About 

I am currently an MSc student of [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML)](https://ucl-ellis.github.io) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com) where I developed Gaussian Process models for time-series forecasting, transformer-based NLP models for customer support automation, and LSTM-based models for user churn prediction. I completed my undergraduate degree in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

<!-- My academic interests lie in the areas of statistics and machine learning. -->
