I am currently a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.gridmatic.com">Gridmatic</a>.

Previously, I was a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> where I developed and productionised Gaussian processes for time-series forecasting, transformer-based NLP models for customer support automation, and LSTM-based models for user personalisation. 

I completed my MSc. in <a href="https://ucl-ellis.github.io">Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML)</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>, working on generalised variational inference for Gaussian processes with <a href="https://jeremiasknoblauch.github.io">Jeremias Knoblauch</a> in the Department of Statistical Science. Before that, I completed my BASc. in <a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/">Engineering Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> with a specialisation in robotics. 

My research interests lie in the areas of uncertainty quantification and variational inference.
