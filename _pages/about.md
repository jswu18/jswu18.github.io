I am currently an MSc. student of <a href="https://ucl-ellis.github.io">Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML)</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>, working with <a href="https://jeremiasknoblauch.github.io">Jeremias Knoblauch</a> in the Department of Statistical Science.

Previously, I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> where I developed and productionised Gaussian Process models for time-series forecasting, transformer-based NLP models for customer support automation, and LSTM-based models for user personalisation. I completed my BASc. in <a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/">Engineering Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. 

My research interests lie in the areas of statistical inference and variational methods.
