Accurate neuronavigation is essential for optimal outcomes in therapeutic brain stimulation. MRI-guided neuronavigation, the current gold standard, requires access to MRI and frameless stereotaxic equipment, which is not available in all settings. Scalp-based heuristics depend on operator skill, with variable reproducibility across operators and sessions. An intermediate solution would offer superior reproducibility and ease-of-use to scalp measurements, without requiring MRI and frameless stereotaxy.
